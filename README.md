# Movie Recommendation System

## Capston Project for Coursera Duke university course on Java programming.

In this project I've developed a program to recommend movies for a user.

## Specifically I've done the follwoing

1. Read in and parse move and rating data into lists and maps;
1. Calculate average ratings;
1. Calculate how similar a given rater is to another user based on ratings; 
1. Recommend movies to a given user based on ratings. 
1. Display recommended movies for a given user on a webpage.

# Result
1. First user will be prompt to rate certain number of movies, these rating will be used to make recommendation for the user

1. After having user submited his rating list, dispay the recommendation movie list for him.
